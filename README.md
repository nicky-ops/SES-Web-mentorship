# Internet and Web Basics
## Introduction to the internet
The internet is a global network of computers.
A **Server** is a special computer connected directly to the internet.
A **webpage** is a file on the server's hard drive.
A client is indireclty connected to the internet via an **ISP (Internet Service Provider)**
### What is an IP address?
Because the internet is an interconnection of computers, each computer connected to the internet must have a unique address known as **IP(Internet Protocol) address.**
An **IP** (Internet Protocol) address is used by your computer when it wants to communicate with another device on the web or intranet.
When you connect to the internet via an ISP, you are assigned a temporary IP address for the duration of your dial-in session. When you connect from a LAN, your device might have a permanent IP address of might obtain a temporary one from a **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol(DHCP) Server**.

### Protocol Stacks and Packets
#### TCP/IP Model

#### OSI Model

##### Application Layer: HTTP, FTP etc...
##### Transport layer: UDP, TCP
##### Networking layer: IPv4 & IPv6
##### Link layer: Ethernet, WiFI
#### DNS - Domain Name System
DNS translates domain names into ip addresses for us.
It also helps in finding out which servers are hosting our website or webpages.
#### Port Numbers
Ports allow different applications running at one time from using the same port number.
For example if we have two programs that both use port 80 then they will not be able to run simultaneously as they would conflict with each other. For example if we have 8080 open then another application can't use that port because it will be taken by the first app.
For example if you have two browsers open they will use ports 80 and 8080 respectively. This allows them both to run simultaneously without interfering with each other.

#### Firewalls
Firewalls block unwanted traffic. They can be used as security devices.
They filter packets based on their source and destination ips.

#### Proxy Servers
Proxy servers act like gateways between two networks. It acts as a middle man so that we don't have direct access to the internet.
Proxy servers sit between your browser and websites you visit so that they can add extra features like caching pages locally.
Proxy servers act like gateways between your browser and websites you visit online.
They intercept requests made by users and send them through to the real target site.
This allows people around the world access to content that they would not normally have access to.
#### SSL / TLS Encryption
SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer whereas TLS stands for Transport Layer Security.
Both provide encryption over data sent across networks.
TLS has replaced SSL but it still works with older browsers so we will use both terms interchangeably when talking about this topic.
TLS has been superseded by newer versions but still widely supported due to its widespread use.
#### What is HTTP
HTTP is short for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It defines how information is transmitted over the internet.
It uses a request response protocol whereby clients make http requests to servers and then receive responses back with relevant info.
When we type www.google.com into our browsers url bar it sends a request message containing this string along with other metadata.

#### Domain name
Domain names are human readable identifiers for websites. For example google.co.uk is a domain name.
These domains are registered with ICANN who maintains a global database of all valid domain names.
ICANN assigns each domain name 1 year to live before it expires so we should register new ones often.

#### Hosting
Hosting refers to where files such as html pages, images, videos, audio clips stored. This could be local storage or cloud services.

### Browsers and how they work
A browser is an application that lets you view pages stored on the Internet (web browsers).
The most popular types of browsers include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera, Brave and Vivaldi among others.
Web browsers communicate via protocols such as http, https, ftp, smtp, pop3 among others.
The most common protocol used today is called hypertext transfer protocol or http.
When you type www.google.com into Google Chrome's address bar then press enter, what happens?
Well firstly, the computer looks up the IP Address associated with this URL.
